# TMU Internship(May25-July25)

ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection App â€“ Internship at TMU

During my internship under Dr. Rakesh Dwivedi, Head of the CCSIT Department at Teerthanker Mahaveer University (TMU), I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge applications of Artificial Intelligence in the medical domain.

Under the guidance of Mr. Pandey, the supervisor of the B.Tech program, I developed a Brain Tumor Detection App that uses machine learning and image processing techniques to identify and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

ðŸ”¬ Project Highlights:
	â€¢	ðŸ“Š Dataset Used: Pre-processed MRI brain scan dataset categorized into tumor vs. non-tumor images.
	â€¢	ðŸ§  Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
	â€¢	ðŸ’¡ Functionality: Upload MRI images, process them through the model, and display tumor prediction and confidence score.
	â€¢	ðŸ“± Interface: Simple web-based front end built using Streamlit, enabling quick drag-and-drop functionality for image input.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
	â€¢	Achieved over 95% accuracy on validation data.
	â€¢	Explored model explainability through Grad-CAM visualizations.
	â€¢	Helped me understand real-world AI applications in healthcare, especially the intersection of medical imaging and deep learning.

This experience not only strengthened my technical foundation but also deepened my interest in solving impactful problems using AI and data science.
